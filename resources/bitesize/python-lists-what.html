          <p class="section-padding">
            List comprehension is a Pythonic method of creating lists. List
            comprehensions allow us to efficiently create lists in fewer lines
            of code than other methods. A major benefit of list comprehension is
            that it can be used to create and filter lists in just a single line
            of code.
          </p>
          <p class="section-padding">
            Now we know what the concept is, how do we go about using it? Let’s
            dive in and take a look!
          </p>

          Let’s suppose we have a list of names, and for whatever reason, we
          want to copy the names to a new list. A naive solution to this problem
          would would be to use a standard <b class="code-text">‘for’</b> loop
          which runs through the list of names and appends them to a new list:
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span
              ><span class="blue">names </span>=
              <span class="pink">['Barry, 'Anika', 'Zuri', 'Tomas']</span></span
            >
            <br />
            <span
              ><span class="blue">new_names_list</span> =
              <span class="pink">[]</span></span
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <span
              ><span class="orange">for </span><span class="blue">name </span
              ><span class="orange">in </span
              ><span class="blue"> names</span>:</span
            >
            <div class="code-indent4">
              <span
                ><span class="blue">new_names_list</span>.<span class="orange"
                  >append(</span
                ><span class="blue">name</span
                ><span class="orange">)</span></span
              >
            </div>
            <br />
            <span
              ><span class="orange">print(</span
              ><span class="blue">new_names_list</span
              ><span class="orange">)</span></span
            >
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="section-padding">This will result in the below output:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span
              ><span class="pink"
                >['Barry, 'Anika', 'Zuri', 'Tomas']</span
              ></span
            >
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-padding">
          The output is correct, so you may be wondering what’s wrong with the
          above code? Well, there’s nothing technically wrong with it. It does
          the job just fine.
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          However, it doesn’t leverage all of the language features Python makes
          available to us. Python emphasises less-cluttered syntax, which allows
          us to do more with less code, while maintaining readability. This
          style of coding is referred as Pythonic, and Pythonic code is
          sometimes described as being “beautiful.”
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          So, let’s put that claim to the test! Take a look at the following
          code, which achieves the same result as our first example:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span
              ><span class="blue">names </span>=
              <span class="pink">['Barry, 'Anika', 'Zuri', 'Tomas']</span></span
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <span
              ><span class="blue">new_names_list</span> =
              <span class="pink">[</span><span class="blue">name </span
              ><span class="orange">for </span><span class="blue">name </span
              ><span class="orange">in </span><span class="blue">names</span
              ><span class="pink">]</span></span
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <span
              ><span class="orange">print(</span
              ><span class="blue">new_names_list</span
              ><span class="orange">)</span></span
            >
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="section-padding">Our result is the exact same:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span
              ><span class="pink"
                >['Barry, 'Anika', 'Zuri', 'Tomas']</span
              ></span
            >
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-padding">
          We’ve managed to take the previous for-loop approach and turn it into
          a single line of code, which does the exact same thing. Beautiful, no?
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          The structure of a list comprehension looks like this:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span
              ><span class="pink">[</span><span class="blue">expression </span
              ><span class="orange">for </span><span class="blue">member </span
              ><span class="orange">in </span><span class="blue">iterable</span
              ><span class="pink">]</span></span
            >
            <br />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="section-padding">
          When starting out, it is generally easier to read the expressions
          within a list comprehension from right to left. In the above, let’s
          start with: 
          <br>
          <b class="code-text">for member in iterable</b> (this maps to
          <b class="code-text">for name in names</b> in our concrete example
          above).
          <br>
          This is a simple for loop, and tells Python to loop through
          the members in our list.
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          The <b class="code-text">expression</b> (the first instance of
          <b class="code-text">name</b> in the concrete example), is what will
          be put into our new list. By saying
          <b class="code-text">name for name</b>, we are telling Python that we
          want the names copied exactly as they are.
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          In other words, the code
          <b class="code-text">[name for name in names]</b> tells Python to loop
          through the names list, and create a new list out of each name within
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          This can be a bit confusing to get your head around at first, but as
          we look at more examples in the next few cards, it will become
          clearer.
