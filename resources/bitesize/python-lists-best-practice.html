            List Comprehension is great! We’ve seen it turn multiple lines of code into a single line, we’ve seen it handle expressions as well as conditionals; heck, it could even change values in a list compared to the original. So, we'd want to use List Comprehension all the time, no?
            <br>
            Not always, here are some things to think about when decideding whether to use list comprehension or not.

          <span>The first is a bit technical: List Comprehension runs faster in the system’s memory than a standard loop. In reality, this likely won’t notably increase running speed on smaller projects almost certainly wouldn’t affect you much with the kinds of datasets you’ll handle in the course material, but this is a good example of a reason for chosing to use list comprehension. </span>

          <span>You might have noticed that list comprehensions are rather abstract in their readability, and whilst this makes them quicker for the most part, one reason not to use them is simply good old fashioned human readability. The system will be able to read a highly convoluted piece of List Comprehension with no issue, but your fellow developer or even yourself in six months’ time...not so likely.

          The small examples we’ve seen here are generally very readable and would be fine as genuine use cases for List Comprehension. If we wanted to add several different conditionals or expressions, for example – that’s the time to stick with a standard ‘for’ loop. While you could technically write it in a single-line piece of List Comprehension, it would be nigh-on impossible to read or make sense of.
        </span>
        </div>
        <p class="section-padding">
          The general rule of thumb will be that if the logic requires a simple loop with the odd expression and/or conditional, save yourself some time and pop it in a piece of List Comprehension. If the logic requires multiple conditionals, expressions and simply looks to achieve a lot of things, pop it in a standard loop.

          As a final bonus, if you want a good example of when not to use List Comprehension, this is it:
