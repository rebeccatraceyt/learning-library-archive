            As mentioned on the previous card, the first part of a list comprehension is the expression. We also saw an example where we used a list comprehension to copy the contents of one list into another. The expression in this list comprehension simply told Python to copy the current item into a new list - this is quite a limited use case for list comprehension. With that in mind, let’s dig a bit deeper into what we can do with expressions.

          Let’s assume we want to create a list of the first ten square numbers, starting from zero. We could use a standard ‘for’ loop to achieve this, or we could use a list comprehension to achieve it in a single line.
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          Let’s take a look at the code and its output first, then discuss how it works:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
              <span><span class="blue">squared_nums </span>= <span class="pink"
              >[</span><span class="blue">i </span>*<span class="blue"> i </span><span class="pink">for </span
              ><span class="blue">i </span><span class="pink">in </span
                ><span class="green">range</span><span class="orange">(10)</span><span class="pink"
                      >]</span></span>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span><span class="orange"
                        >print(</span
                      ><span class="blue">squared_nums</span><span class="orange"
                      >)</span>
                      <br>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="code-block section-padding">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span><span class="pink">[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 59, 64, 81]</span
              ></span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="section-padding">
          So, what’s going on here? Unlike with the previous <b class="code-text">‘names’</b> example, we’re actually using a proper expression here, in order to get our squared numbers. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          If we imagine this as a standard <b class="code-text">‘for’</b> loop, the <b class="code-text">‘i’</b> variable will be our loop counter that runs through the range of numbers from 0-9 (ranges exclude the final number) – so, ‘i’ will represent 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on during each run of the loop.  
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          Then, in our expression, we multiply that number by itself to get squared total, which is appended to the list <b class="code-text">– i * i</b> (0x0, 1x1, 2x2 etc). 
        </p>
        <p class="section-padding">
          For clarity, this would be the alternative <b class="code-text">‘for’</b> loop approach, which will achieve the same result:
        </p>


        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="code-text code-container box-shadow">
            <span><span class="blue">squared_nums </span>= <span class="pink"
              >[]</span></span>
              <br>
              <br>
              
              <span class="pink">for </span><span class="blue">i </span><span class="pink">in </span
              ><span class="green">range</span><span class="orange">(10)</span>:
              <div class="code-indent2">
                <span clsss="blue"
                      >squared_nums</span>.<span class="orange"
                      >append(<span class="blue">i </span>*<span class="blue"> i</span>)</span>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span><span class="orange"
                        >print(</span
                      ><span class="blue">squared_nums</span><span class="orange"
                      >)</span>
                      <br>

              </div>
              
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-padding">
          A useful exercise is to compare the above code with the list comprehension code, and see how the logic is translated. For example, the ‘i’ variable is used the same number of times in both approaches, just in a slightly different places. 

        </p>
        
        <p class="section-padding">
          In the list comprehension approach, the expression (or the work we want to do) comes at the start rather than within the loop itself. This is why it is often easier to read the expressions in a list comprehension from right to left - it more closely matches the structure of a standard loop.
